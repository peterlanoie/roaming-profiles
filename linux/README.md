# Linux helpers

## `.bash_aliases`

Some aliases for bash.

Add the following to your `.bashrc` or equivalent

```
source /{repo clone path}/linux/.bash_aliases
```
Depending on where it is (shared in a windows `/mnt/?` location?) you might need to make it executable.
```
chmod +x /{repo clone path}/linux/.bash_aliases
```
